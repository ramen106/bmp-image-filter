# BMP Image Filter in C++

This project is a C++ image filtering program for 24-bit BMP images. It applies visual effects using raw file access and pixel-by-pixel manipulation. It demonstrates low-level image processing and good modular C++ design.

It was originally built as part of the CS50 Memory problem set, but rather than using their distribution code and building it in C,
I decided to build everything from scratch (as much as possible, online help was used) and in C++.

## Features

- Grayscale (gamma-corrected, linear color space)

- Blur (box blur kernel)

- Sobel Edge Detection (based on gradient magnitude)

- Reflect (horizontal mirror)

- Easy to extend â€” filters live in a modular `ImageFilters` namespace

## Build Instructions

### On Windows (with MSVC)

1. Open **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**
2. Run:

```bash
cl src\main.cpp src\filters.cpp /I include /W4 /EHsc /Fe:filter.exe
```
3. Then run the program.

### On Linux / WSL / MinGW
```bash
g++ src/main.cpp src/filters.cpp -Iinclude -o filter
./filter
```

## Concepts Demonstrated
1. Manual parsing of BMP headers & pixel data

2. Binary file I/O

3. Gamma correction using linear light space

4. Sobel gradient convolution (edge detection)

5. Structs, vectors, and clean namespace usage in C++

## Sample Use
When the program runs, it prompts you to

1. Enter a .bmp image filename

2. Select a filter (blurred, grayscaled, reflected, edges)

3. It saves the new image as: grayscaled_input.bmp, blurred_input.bmp, etc.

## Possible improvements

- I hope to add more features in the future:
    1. More color tints, a sharpen, and other types of filters.
    2. a GUI.
    3. Improve performance as I feel right now it's slower and hogs more memory than it needs to.
    4. Expand image format support

- But I suppose for now it's finished, and I can come back to it when I improve my skills.
