BMP STRUCTURE FIELD DESCRIPTIONS (from MSDN):

- BITMAPFILEHEADER:
    bfType:       Specifies the file type; must be 'BM' for bitmap files.
    bfSize:       Specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    bfReserved1:  Reserved; must be zero.
    bfReserved2:  Reserved; must be zero.
    bfOffBits:    Specifies the offset, in bytes, from the BITMAPFILEHEADER to the bitmap bits.

- BITMAPINFOHEADER:
    biSize:          Specifies the number of bytes required by the structure.
    biWidth:         Specifies the width of the bitmap, in pixels.
    biHeight:        Specifies the height of the bitmap, in pixels.
    biPlanes:        Specifies the number of planes for the target device; must be set to 1.
    biBitCount:      Specifies the number of bits per pixel.
    biCompression:   Specifies the type of compression for a compressed bitmap.
    biSizeImage:     Specifies the size, in bytes, of the image. May be set to zero for BI_RGB bitmaps.
    biXPelsPerMeter: Specifies the horizontal resolution, in pixels per meter, of the target device.
    biYPelsPerMeter: Specifies the vertical resolution, in pixels per meter, of the target device.
    biClrUsed:       Specifies the number of color indexes in the color table that are actually used by the bitmap.
    biClrImportant:  Specifies the number of color indexes that are required for displaying the bitmap.

- RGBTRIPLE:
    rgbtBlue:   Blue intensity.
    rgbtGreen:  Green intensity.
